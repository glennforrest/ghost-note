# Ghost Note

[Ghost Note](https://glennforrest.github.io/ghost-note/) is a ~~large textarea in a window~~ simple note taking desktop application that throws away whatever you write as soon as you close the window.

## ðŸ¤” But Why?
Sometimes you just need to quickly modify some text in a notepad with no intentions of saving it. Dealing with the save prompt was so much of a hassle that I thought, yep I should waste my time making an application only I will use ~~I probably won't even use it...~~.
